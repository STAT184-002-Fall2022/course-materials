## Group warm-up

Discuss the following with people nearby. Try to clear up the muddiest points, or bring it up to discuss as a class.

- What is something you learned about Tidy Data and Computing with R this past week?
- What's a "Codebook"?
- How did the GitHub activity go?
- What was the muddiest point?  Either...
    - Got stuck & still stuck
    - Got stuck & figured it out

## Code Book Example 

- Federal Elections Comission 
  - https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data




## Tidy Data

- Key ideas:
  - Cases = Rows
  - Variables = Columns 
- How should we define **case**?
- How do we identify **variables**?
- Can data be presented in more than one way such that each is still **tidy** by definition?
    - If No, why not?
    - If Yes, how can we tell which is the correct form of **tidy** data?



## Galton Data

In the 1880s, Francis Galton started to make a mathematical theory of evolution.  

Here's part of a page from his lab notebook.  Discuss the following in groups:

- What might he investigate with these data (e.g., **Research Question**)?
- Are these data **tidy** according to our definition?
- What are the **cases**?
- What are the **variables**?
- How many **rows** of data should the result have?
- How many **columns** of data should the result have?  What is the data type of each column?
- What are some additional variables (not yet shown) that might be of interest?  How would you recommend showing that information in the data table?

## Activity: Put these into tidy form.  

- Work with your partner 
- As a team, you will put two different data sets into "tidy" form.  
- **See Canvas for details**
    - View-only source data is provided
    - use any software you like
    - must submit a CSV to Canvas 
    - do not use spaces in your file names 
- Tip: **Sketch things out together on paper before you do anything in the computer**

#### Table 2: **Marital status in the US armed forces**
